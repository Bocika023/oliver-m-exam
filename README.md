# Exam 0.0.1

Lesson: Git and HTML
Level: 1

### Hint #1:

If you add the ID of a ticket then you can close it automatically.

This commit fixes #xxx
This commit fixed #xxx
This commit fix #xxx
This commit closes #xxx
This commit close #xxx
This commit closed #xxx

If you put the ID of a ticket but without fix/close keywords then
you can attach your commit to a ticket.

This commit should solve most of #xxx

Where xxx is the ID of a ticket.


### Hint #2:

xxxxxxxx

### Hint #3:

xxxxxxxx
